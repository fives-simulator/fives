# Config for a look-alike Theta@ALCF system
# - 41 HDD per node (6TB each) - configured into a distributed RAID (modeled as a single disk)
# - 1 OST per OSS, 56 OSS (considering one OSS per node)
# - Total of 9.2 PB in Lustre (theta-fs0) with agg bw ~ 240GBps
# Compute side has 4392 nodes in a Dragonfly topo (we have slightly more in the end, at ~4600 nodes)
